# Reactive CLI Application with Spring Shell

This project is a **Reactive Command-Line Interface (CLI)** application built using **Spring Shell** and **Spring Data JPA**. It showcases how to create interactive commands for database operations using a reactive approach. The CLI provides custom commands to manage product information in a database, making it a lightweight and efficient tool for developers and administrators.

### Features:
- **Interactive CLI Commands**: Users can interact with the database through intuitive shell commands.
- **Product Management**: Includes commands to add, view, and manage product entries in the database.
- **Customizable Greeting Command**: A sample command (`hello`) to greet the user with a specified name and number of iterations.
- **Built-in Test Command**: Simple command (`test`) to check the functionality of the CLI.
- **Reactive Repository Integration**: Uses a reactive repository (`ProductRepository`) to perform non-blocking CRUD operations on `Product` entities.
  
### Available Commands:
1. **hello**
   - **Description**: Prints a greeting message a specified number of times.
   - **Usage**: `hello --name <your-name> --counter <number-of-repetitions>`
   - **Example**: `hello --name fahd --counter 3`

2. **test**
   - **Description**: Returns a simple success message.
   - **Usage**: `test`
   
3. **add-product**
   - **Description**: Adds a new product to the database.
   - **Usage**: `add-product --name <product-name> --price <product-price>`
   - **Example**: `add-product --name "Laptop" --price 1200.50`
   
4. **get-product**
   - **Description**: Retrieves a product by its ID and displays its details.
   - **Usage**: `get-product --id <product-id>`
   - **Example**: `get-product --id 1`

### Technologies:
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Shell**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **H2 Database** (for demonstration purposes)

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run`.
4. Once the application starts, enter the command-line interface.
5. Use the commands listed above to interact with the application.
